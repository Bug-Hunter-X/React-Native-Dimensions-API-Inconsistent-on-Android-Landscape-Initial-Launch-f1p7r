This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions on Android, specifically when the app is run in a landscape orientation for the first time. The `width` and `height` values returned by `Dimensions.get('window')` might be incorrect, often flipped or with zero values.  Subsequent orientation changes might resolve the issue, but the initial load is broken. This is inconsistent behavior between different Android devices and versions.
